1.
	a) friend 2 and friend 4
	b) friends 1, 3, 4
	c) Friend$5.friendsWith, friendsWith.Friend$5
	d) Friend$5 in Friend$2.^friendsWith && Friend$4 in Friend$5.^friendsWith => true
	e) some f: Friend | f.^friendsWith = univ
	f) univ->univ = ^friendsWith
	g) set {f: Friend| f.^friendsWith = Friend}
	h) Friend$5 is the parameter to degreeOfSeperation. I think it is the parameter just because alloy arbitrarily chooses the last one

2.
	a) (InitTest$0 -> 0)
	b) These results are absolutly mad bonkers, yo! It produced the same thing as the previous model.
	c) This fixed the issue. This is because the bit width was limited to 3. With 7 bits, you can represent 10.
	d) x=3, y=2. It is not good because dealing with bit widths can give you some subtle bugs and the syntax is not intuitive for this
