The programs in this folder demonstrate the use of the "fork", "wait", "waitpid", "getpid" and "exec" family of system calls.

The "myCopy.c" file is used to create a stand-alone executable "myCopy" which is then used to demonstrate the "execv" and "execlp" systems calls. The program copies the contents of an input file to an output file, the names of which are specified at the command prompt.

processes.c and processes.h are used to creat an executable "processes" which demonstrates a fork fan that reads Files.txt for file names, then copies them
