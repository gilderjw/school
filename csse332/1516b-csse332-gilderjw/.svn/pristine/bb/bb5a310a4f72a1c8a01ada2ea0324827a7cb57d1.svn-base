A) It will run alright, can be faster with more kernel threads to saturate all the cores, since not saturated, some cores will be idle

B) optimal saturated cores is the fastest you can do as long as no threads get blocked, if one gets blocked, one more would be optimal

C) still good, if one thread is blocked, another can run. But it will be suboptimal because contact switching is needed and is wasted overhead
