this file demonstrates the use of threads to sort an input file using a brute force, bubble, and merge sort for different parts of the data. 

ussage: ./threads <number of threads> <infile> <outfile>

reads the data from the input file expecting a list of numbers seperated by new lines and outputs a sorted list of the data into outfile

will print running times of individial parts of sorts including minimum, maximum and mean values of run times

ex:
