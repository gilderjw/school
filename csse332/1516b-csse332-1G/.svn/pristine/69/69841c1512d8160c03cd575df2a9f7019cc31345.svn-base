We made a real neeto shell for our OS

Shell commands
	type [fileName]                  - prints out [fileName] (basically cat) 
  execute [fileName]               - starts [fileName] (./) 
  delete [fileName]                - deletes [fileName] (rm)
  copy [fileName], [file2]         - copy [fileName] to [file2] (cp)
  dir                              - prints directory and number of sectors occupied
  create [fileName]                - create a file named [fileName] allows user to input text
  kill [fileName]                  - kill process with given pid
  listpids [fileName]              - lists all the running processes and pids
  exfg [fileName]                  - executes [fileName] and blocks shell until termination
  setbg [Color]                    - changes background to [Color]
  cls                              - clears the screen (cls)
  NSA                              - wipes everything on drive to hide from NSA
  help                             - displays this message
