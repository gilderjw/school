We made a real neeto shell for our OS

Shell commands
	-type <filename>
		prints the file given (basically cat)

	-execute <filname>
		executes the file given

You can verify functionality by:
	1. run make
	2. start bochs
	3. type in "type messag" (this will print a message)
	4. type in "execute tstpr2" (this will also print a message)
	5. if you mistype, you will get the message "You are bad and you should feel bad"
