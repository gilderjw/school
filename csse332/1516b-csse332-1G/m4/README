We made a real neeto shell for our OS

Shell commands
	-delete <filename>
		removes the file from the system

	-copy <filein> <fileout>
		copies file from one name to the other

	-dir
		lists all files in directory as well as size

	-create <filename>
		accepts user input until two new lines
		puts information in a file


You can verify functionality by:
	1. run make
	2. start bochs
	3. type "create test"
	4. type a message to store into the file followed by two new lines
	5. type copy test newtest
	6. type dir
	7. you will see the file that you created and the one that you copied
	8. type type newtest
	9. you should see the contents from the file that you made
