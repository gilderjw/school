<h1>WARNING:</h1>
<p>
Do not change the names of the video and screen capture files which Ovo Logger creates.  Do not move these files out of the Tapes directory.  Doing either of these things corrupts the linkage between your Logged Observations and your video/screen capture files.  You do so at your own risk.  You can change the default file naming convention using the controls at the bottom of Ovo Logger's Configure Video/Screen Capture Source dialog, located on the Tools menu.
