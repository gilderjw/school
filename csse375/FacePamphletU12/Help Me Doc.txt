Here is a quick overview of how the image attachment system works.

First you need to add an attachment:

Write the full image location in the textbox above add attachment.
	Here are a couple examples of what they should look like they will be a little
	different on your computer.

	(C:\Users\schaffqg\Desktop\CSSE374\FacePamphletU12\images\Penguins)

Then click the add atachment button. This sets the typed in file as the current attachment

When you create a comment or a new status it will look to see if there is a curr attachment

If there is one, then it will print that information into the status/comment.
