* What to do

Implement a linear version of the classic lights out game.  In this
game, you start with some configuration of Xs and Os:

: O O O O X X

and when you click a particular element, it reverses that element and
all the elements adjacent to it.  So in the example above, if we
clicked the 2nd to last element, it would switch to

: O O O X O O

You'll implement this using html buttons, so it will look like this
(or similar):

I started my version by editing the button example here:

* Some minor details

1.  You are not required to implement any win condition detection
2.  We won't deal with randomness, so you can start your game by
    pre-initializing it to a particular configuration
3.  The 2 edge buttons should only update 2 lights
4.  Your solution should handle an arbitrary number of lights
    depending on how the model is initially initialized
